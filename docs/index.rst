Bayesian Additive Regression Trees for Probabilistic programming with PyMC


Overview
============
PyMC-BART extends `PyMC <https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc>`_ probabilistic programming framework to be able to define
and solve models including a BART random variable.  PyMC-BART also includes a few helpers function to aid with the
interpretation of those models and perform variable selection.


Installation
============

PyMC-BART requires a working Python interpreter (3.8+). We recommend installing Python and key numerical libraries using the `Anaconda distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads>`_, which has one-click installers available on all major platforms.

Assuming a standard Python environment is installed on your machine, PyMC-BART itself can be installed either using pip or conda-forge.

**Using pip**

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pymc-bart

**Using conda-forge**

.. code-block:: bash

     conda install -c conda-forge pymc-bart

**Development**

Alternatively, if you want the bleeding edge version of the package you can install from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-bart.git
