Bayesian Additive Regression Trees for Probabilistic programming with PyMC

## Overview
PyMC-BART extends [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) probabilistic programming framework to be able to define and solve models including a BART random variable. PyMC-BART also includes a few helpers function to help interpret those models and perform variable selection. 


## Installation

PyMC-BART requires a working Python interpreter (3.8+). We recommend installing Python and key numerical libraries using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads), which has one-click installers available on all major platforms.

Assuming a standard Python environment is installed on your machine (including pip), PyMC-BART itself can be installed in one line using pip:

    pip install pymc-bart

Alternatively, if you want the bleeding edge version of the package you can install from GitHub:

    pip install git+https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-bart.git
