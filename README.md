# Bayesian Additive Regression Trees for Probabilistic programming with PyMC

![pymc-bart logo](docs/logos/pymc_bart.png)

PyMC-BART extends [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) probabilistic programming framework to be able to define and solve models including a BART random variable. PyMC-BART also includes a few helpers function to aid with the interpretation of those models and perform variable selection.


## Installation

PyMC-BART is available on Conda-Forge. To set up a suitable Conda environment, run

```bash
conda create --name=pymc-bart --channel=conda-forge pymc-bart
conda activate pymc-bart
```

Alternatively, it can be installed with

```bash
pip install pymc-bart
```

In case you want to upgrade to the bleeding edge version of the package you can install from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-bart.git
```
